# Golden-Helmet
IOT-Based Miner Safety System
The Golden Helmet system comprises a mobile app, helmet, and bracelet, all of which work together to detect harmful gases and vital signs of miners. Using embedded system technology and Flutter development, our project is able to gather real-time data from miners' helmets and bracelets, transmitting this information to the supervisor's mobile app. This allows for swift action to be taken in the event of an emergency, ultimately saving lives.

At its core, the Golden Helmet system is a powerful tool for ensuring the safety and well-being of miners. We are proud of what we have accomplished and are excited to see the impact that our project could have in the mining industry.
